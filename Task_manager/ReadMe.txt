Hello,

I tried really hard with this submission. I was not able to get the unittest function to work in the end: I am finding it very difficult to 
understand 'mock', 'patch' decorators, and so on. These were not covered in the course materials, but I could not find a way to meaningfully test 
my code's functionality without them. Could you please advise on how to proceed on this task? Thanks, Miles
